- **Visual Metaphors**: Slack-inspired workspace organization with GitHub developer aesthetics
- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Minimal interface that prioritizes content readability

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: Analogous (professional blue-gray base with warm orange accents)
- **Primary Color**: Deep blue-gray (oklch(0.3 0.05 240)) for primary actions and focus
- **Secondary Colors**: Light blue-gray (oklch(0.95 0.02 240)) for subtle backgrounds
- **Accent Color**: Warm orange (oklch(0.65 0.15 40)) for active states and attention
- **Color Psychology**: Blue-gray conveys professionalism and trust, orange adds energy and focus
- **Color Accessibility**: All combinations exceed WCAG AA contrast requirements
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**:
  - Primary text on background: oklch(0.2 0.02 240) on oklch(0.98 0.005 240) - 16.8:1 contrast
  - Accent text on accent background: oklch(1 0 0) on oklch(0.65 0.15 40) - 4.9:1 contrast
  - Secondary text on secondary background: oklch(0.25 0.03 240) on oklch(0.95 0.02 240) - 11.2:1 contrast

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Single family (Inter) with varied weights for hierarchy
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Bold titles (700), medium headers (600), normal body (400)
- **Font Personality**: Clean, readable, modern sans-serif appropriate for business communication
- **Readability Focus**: 1.5 line height, adequate letter spacing, appropriate font sizes
- **Typography Consistency**: Consistent sizing scale across all text elements
- **Which fonts**: Inter (400, 500, 600, 700 weights)
- **Legibility Check**: Inter is highly legible at all sizes with excellent screen rendering

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
- **Attention Direction**: Left sidebar for navigation, main content for messages, bottom input for actions
- **White Space Philosophy**: Generous padding around messages and UI elements for breathing room
- **Grid System**: Flexible layout with sidebar and main content areas
- **Responsive Approach**: Mobile-first with sidebar overlay on small screens
- **Content Density**: Balanced density with clear message separation and scannable channel lists

### Animations
- **Purposeful Meaning**: Smooth sidebar transitions communicate spatial relationships
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Sidebar slide animations are primary, subtle hover states are secondary
- **Contextual Appropriateness**: Professional environment calls for subtle, functional animations

### UI Elements & Component Selection
- **Component Usage**: Cards for containers, Buttons for actions, Input for text entry, Avatar for users
- **Component Customization**: Standard shadcn components with theme color customization
- **Component States**: Hover, active, focus, and disabled states for all interactive elements
- **Icon Selection**: Phosphor icons for consistency (Hash, Plus, PaperPlaneRight, List, X, Smiley)
- **Component Hierarchy**: Primary buttons for send actions, secondary for channel management
- **Spacing System**: Consistent 2-4 unit spacing using Tailwind scale
- **Mobile Adaptation**: Touch-friendly button sizes, collapsible sidebar, readable text sizes

### Visual Consistency Framework
- **Design System Approach**: Component-based with consistent theming across all elements
- **Style Guide Elements**: Color variables, spacing scale, typography scale, border radius
