## Setup and Installation

### How do I set up the application?

1. **Clone the repository** and install dependencies
2. **Create a Supabase project** and get your credentials
3. **Set up environment variables** in a `.env` file
4. **Run the database schema** in your Supabase project
5. **Start the development server**

For detailed instructions, see our [Setup Guide](../setup/SUPABASE_SETUP.md).

### Do I need a Supabase account?

Yes, you need a free Supabase account to run the application. Supabase provides:
- PostgreSQL database hosting
- Authentication services

- Array data types

### How is security handled?

Security is implemented through multiple layers:

**Authentication:**
- JWT token-based authentication
- OAuth integration (GitHub and optional Google)

**Authorization:**
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- User-based data access control
- API key management through Supabase

**Data Protection:**
- HTTPS encryption in transit
- Encrypted data at rest
- Input validation and sanitization

### What about performance and scaling?

The application is designed for performance:

**Frontend Performance:**
- React optimization techniques
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Efficient re-rendering strategies

**Backend Scaling:**
- Supabase handles database scaling
- CDN for static asset delivery
- Connection pooling for database efficiency
- Real-time subscription optimization

### How do I handle errors and debugging?

**Error Handling:**
- Comprehensive error boundaries
- User-friendly error messages
- Detailed logging for developers
- Graceful fallbacks for network issues

**Debugging:**

## Troubleshooting

### The application won't start

Check these common issues:

1. **Node.js version** - Ensure you're using Node.js 18+
2. **Dependencies** - Run `npm install` to install packages
3. **Environment variables** - Verify your `.env` file has correct Supabase credentials
4. **Port conflicts** - Try a different port if 5173 is in use

### I can't sign in

Common authentication issues:

1. **Supabase configuration** - Verify your project URL and anon key
2. **OAuth setup** - Check GitHub OAuth app configuration
3. **RLS policies** - Ensure user policies are correctly configured
4. **Network connectivity** - Test connection to Supabase

### Real-time features aren't working

Real-time troubleshooting:

1. **WebSocket connection** - Check browser network tab for WebSocket connections
2. **Supabase real-time** - Verify real-time is enabled for your tables
3. **Firewall issues** - Some networks block WebSocket connections
4. **Browser compatibility** - Ensure your browser supports WebSockets

### Performance is slow

Performance optimization:

1. **Network connection** - Test with different network
2. **Browser extensions** - Disable extensions that might interfere
3. **Clear cache** - Clear browser cache and localStorage
4. **Check console** - Look for JavaScript errors or warnings
